# Cmake-Continues

This repo contains a shell script which run make in continues mode.
The idea comes from Idea editors.
When the Idea monitors your activiteis and as soon as you modify a file, create or move a file it fires compile command and then runs the program.
With this script you run a watch on your folder.
Set your run command and then whenever you modify your files `make` command fires again.
